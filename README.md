# libtrainsim

This repository contains several components that are useful if you want to simulate a driving train.

To build this repository you need to install meson and opencv, all other dependencies should be downloaded by meson and compiled if they are needed but not installed (compiling opencv takes forever so it is recommended to install it manually).
